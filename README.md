## Installation

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system before running the install command.


2. Clone this repository to your machine.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Once the installation is complete, you're ready to run the program!

## Usage

Make sure you have the ***base64*** and ***pyperclip*** libraries installed.

Replace **/Path/to/Your/Audio_file.mp3** with the actual path to your audio file in the audio_to_base64.py file.

Run the audio_to_base64.py program to obtain the Base64 string corresponding to your audio file.

The Base64 string will be **displayed** on the screen, **copied** to the clipboard, and **saved** to a text file.

## Example

**MP3 File** : Bad_Karma.mp3

**Base64 Data** : [Base64|Bad_Karma.mp3.txt](Base64|Bad_Karma.mp3.txt)

I have used this code in my project [Star_Audio_Visualizer](https://github.com/X-Casper/Star_Audio_Visualizer) to convert the audio file 'Bad_Karma.mp3' into Base64 strings.
